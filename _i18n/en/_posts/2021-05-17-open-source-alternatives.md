One of the goals of the creation of the group is defending the open source; and the privacy of everyone. When we talk about it around us, the most frequent answer is kind of "But Google services are so useful! And it's free, how could I replace them?".

And this is right; Google Drive, Docs, YouTube, but also WhatsApp and Messenger, Facebook... All these services are all free, and work really well. But we don't introduce anymore the disastrous policy of data management of Mark Zuckerberg's social network, between others.

And, as says well the Free Software Foundation, we think that each program should allow its users to read its source code. To be able to ensure their privacy is respected, between other!

That's why we always use open source programs and applications, to protect our privacy and defend our ideals.

To allow anyone to switch to a libre environment, we decided to write this list of open source alternative to common applications. It will evolve often; don't hesitate to consult it at multiple times!

## File hosting / cloud

### Nextcloud

To replace Google Drive, [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is one of the best solutions. It's a self-hosted cloud solution, for files, but also for a todo list, contacts, calendar or even cookbooks! It allows you to synchronize all these informations between different clients, on nearly all operating systems. We can also add *Collabora online* or *OnlyOffice*, to replace Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and others.

The main advantage of Nextcloud is that he can work on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), with a hard disk and, of course, a stable internet connection. So you can keep all your data at home, where they'll be secure. The Raspberry Pi is also electricity-efficient.

If you decide to try installing it, there are numerous guides to do so, and you can also find help. You'll learn how a web server works, or even Raspbian's command line!

But it's not always that easy, and you may not want spend time doing that. In this case, you can opt for a service which hosts Nextcloud instances, [freely](https://nextcloud.com/signup/) or paid.

## Messages services

### Main

### Via internet

#### Signal

To replace WhatsApp or Messenger, Signal is a good open source application, which works with the same manner: you give him your phone number to create an account and you can communicate with other who installed the app. It encrypts all your messages so that no other one can read it, and it's even possible to block the access to the application with a biometric authentication or a password.

#### Telegram

Telegram is also a good service where you use your phone number to login, and, of course, everything is encrypted too, except metadata (the sender, the receiver, the date of the message...). You can start "secret chats" which you can then destruct and there will be absolutely no traces of it.

### SMS

#### QKSMS

Phone vendors often use their own application to send and receive SMS, and these ones are rarely (or even never) libre and open source. But there are some anyway, and QKSMS is a very good example! It works very well, without ads, and is customizable.

You can download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS&hl=en_US&gl=US), but we recommend you to download it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.moez.QKSMS/).

## Search engines

## Browsers

## Operating systems

As they are the base of any usage of computers, operating system msut of course respect open source and privacy criterias.

### GNU / Linux

We don't present it anymore : GNU / Linux, or just Linux, is an operating system mostly open source. There are versions for all levels, which allow more and more to use or replace Windows apps; even for games, with Proton and Lutris! There are a lot of guides on how to install it and get started, and we strongly recommend you to test if you never done it, in a virtual machine of with a USB stick.

Linux often have the reputation of being a system for advanced users; but some distributions, like Ubuntu, are very accessible to beginners. And if you look for help, you'll surely find a lot of people ready to help you!

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/)..., or [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), or even [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) for beginners.

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) or [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) for advanced users wanting to learn more!

### Android and its custom ROMs

If you didn't know it yet, Android is an open source operating system (it works with the Linux kernel!). But the changes made by the vendors aren't always open.

Fortunately, there are a lot of solutions, and for all tastes: Android custom ROMs. Their installation can be a little bit hard, but some bring interesting functionnalities, and / or a more important control of your dvice. They can also be more respectful of your privacy and, of course, open source.

A well-known custom ROM is, for example, *LineageOS*.

If you want more informations, on your device, on a custom ROM, or some guides, you can see the forum [XDA-developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-most-popular-custom-roms-on-xda/), or on the official websites on these ROMs.
